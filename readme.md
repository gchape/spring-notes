# Spring Framework Notes

This repository contains my personal notes on the **Spring Framework**, covering configuration using both **XML** and **annotations** and more. These notes serve as a reference for future use.

## Contents
- **XML-based Configuration** – Notes on configuring Spring using XML files.
- **Annotation-based Configuration** – Notes on using annotations to configure Spring components.
- **Transactions**
- **JPA/Hibernate**
- **Spring Data JPA**

These notes are not intended as a complete guide but as a quick reference for concepts I may need to revisit.

Feel free to browse through the notes if they help you, but they are primarily for personal reference.
